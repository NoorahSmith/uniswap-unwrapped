# Curve

There are 3 types of pools -

1. Plain pool
2. Lending pools
3. Meta pools

## Plain pools

- It's the simplest implementation of Curve, where all assets all assets in the pool are ordinary ERC-20 tokens.

## Lending Pools

- Some pools in curve are lending pools that means you can earn interest from lending as well as trading fees.

## MetaPools

- Metapools allow for one token to seemingly trade with another underlying base pool. e.g. we can create Gemini USD metapool: [GUSD, [3Pool]]
